## Launchpad

### Assignment Description

This is a 4-part assignment.

**Part I:** 
Make code for a countdown from 10 to 0 that prints in the serial monitor.

**Part II:** 
Make a red light flash each second of the countdown and have a green one turn on at launch.

**Part III:** 
Add a button that triggers the launch.

**Part IV:** 
Move a servo on liftoff as if it were the launch tower.

### Reflection

**Part I:**
This was a very simple start, but I made sure to use a for loop to make the countdown as simple as possible.

**Part II:**
I had a bit of difficulty in getting the lights to turn on, which I realize was because I had the wrong pins. Since they aren't labled on the Pico I plugged one LED into ground and the other into pin 2 instead of 4, but after I fixed that it was pretty simple.

**Part III:**
The button gave me more trouble than it should have. This was due to confusion surrounding the pull up/down built into the pico. If you're pulling DOWN you need one 3.3V wire connected to the button and the other to your pin. If you're pulling UP you need a ground wire to the button and the other to your pin. I was doing the wrong direction of pull for my wiring as I didn't understand the difference between pull up and pull down.

**Part IV:**
Ironically the servo was the easiest part of this whole assignment. We used the circuitpython motor library which made it super simple, and I decided to touch up the code so that it would loop properly. I did decide to do the spicy version again, which I did by replacing the sleeps I used to make the light blink with for loops that swept the servo and slept at the same time.



## Crash Avoidance

### Assignment Description

We need to make a system using an IMU that displays angular data on a little OLED screen and flashes a light if the device is tilted more than 90Â°.\
For the spicy section we need to use an altimeter to have the warning light turn off when you're 3m above ground level.

### Reflection

**Part I:**

I had used an IMU before for a previous assignment, but only for the rotation values. I thought I knew what I was doing but I was thinking of the accelerometer as a velocometer. I didn't realize that gravity existed because I was thinking that I was measuring the change in position and the IMU wasn't moving, but I was measuring the change in velocity, so gravity *did* exist.

**Part II:**

We used the IMU's acceleration value to do the list detection here instead of the angular gyroscope data it gives us, which turned out to be easier as you can use gravity as a reference. This means that the angle value will never drift and you don't have to worry too much about calibration. You just see if the x or y acceleration axes ever have an acceleration around 9.8 (gravity). 

**Part III:**

Adding a screen definitely made the wiring a mess. Code wise I had an issue because I forgot to put the displayio.release_displays() command at the start of my code, which essentially releases the GPIO i2c pins (as the name entails). After that got fixed it worked well, though I had to manually find the i2c adresses of the screen and imu this time, code below (credit to Mr. Miller). I'd also like to thank fstrings for existing, they make inserting variables into strings very easy, just use {*variable*}.

            "I2C addresses found:",
            [hex(device_address) for device_address in i2c.scan()],
        )
        time.sleep(2)

finally:  # unlock the i2c bus when ctrl-c'ing out of the loop
    i2c.unlock()

**Spicy**

I kinda lika da spicy. I'd been wanting to use a sensor like this for a personal project so this was a great learning opportunity.  The sensor can give temperature and pressure, the latter of which can be used to calculate altitude. It's a normal i2c board so getting it up and running is very easy, though it needs thorough calibration to give proper readings, so I just used it to give me the relative difference in altitude for this project by subtracting the current altitude from a set "base" altitude. This is one of the best use cases for a pressure-based altitude sensor like this, as the reading varies based on weather, season, and even if you blow on the sensor.
